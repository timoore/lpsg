* LPSG Version Roadmap
These are the features envisioned for different versions of LPSG,
subject to change of course. The "Testing" heading ideally indicates
test applications or cases that will be written for a specific
version and also gives an idea of the kinds of applications that
would be possible at that point.

** 0.0.1
*** Features
**** shape
**** effect, environment, bundle
**** render queues
**** texture binding (basic)
**** incremental nodes
*** Testing
****   solid examples
***** cube
***** textured cube
****   viewer sets incremental values
****   arcball in viewer
  
** 0.0.2
*** Features
**** rewrite incremental nodes
code that uses incremental node values shouldn't care how nodes are
hooked up.
**** frame buffer objects
**** expand graphic-state
Change from multiple inheritance to composition. Add modes, render target.
**** render targets
**** multiple render queues
**** GC of GL resources
**** GPU timestamps
*** Testing
**** sphere utility function
**** load meshes and textures using classimp

   
** 0.0.3
*** Features
**** render queue sorting
**** download of rendered images
**** text library
Create and display text shapes that are efficient to update
**** renderer validates context
**** assembly
This is an aggregate of shapes, effects, and computation nodes - not
sure if it is necessary.
*** Testing
**** test framework with reference images

** 0.0.4

*** Features

**** upload / download of all Lisp and OpenGL types to buffers and textures

**** foreign storage for mirrored-buffer-resource

**** Lisp storage for textures

**** timing / stats overlay display

**** renderer's draw function runs in seperate thread
*** Testing

**** depth peeling transparency demo

** 1.0
Everything I want in LSPSG in the next year or two (December
2017). These  will features will move into a more specific, earlier release.

*** Features

*** Testing

**** GPU picking
